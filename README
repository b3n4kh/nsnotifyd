nsnotifyd: handle DNS NOTIFY messages by running a command

The "nsnotifyd" daemon monitors a set of DNS zones and runs a command
when any of them change. It listens for DNS NOTIFY messages so it can
respond to changes promptly.

To build, type

	 $ ./configure
	 $ make all

BSD and Mac OS have a sufficiently recent resolver. On a Debian-like
Linux you should install libbind4-dev. Otherwise, the configure script
will download libbind and build and link with it statically.


Thanks to JP Mens for helpful feedback and encouragement.
