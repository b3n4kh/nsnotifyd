nsnotifyd: handle DNS NOTIFY messages by running a command
----------------------------------------------------------

The `nsnotifyd` daemon monitors a set of DNS zones and runs a command
when any of them change. It listens for DNS NOTIFY messages so it can
respond to changes promptly.

To build, type

	 $ ./configure
	 $ make all

BSD and Mac OS have a sufficiently recent resolver. On a Debian-like
Linux you should install libbind4-dev. Otherwise, the configure script
will download libbind and build and link with it statically.

There are two example scripts:

`nsnotify2git` records the history of changes to a set of zones.

`nsnotify2update` uses nsdiff and nsupdate as part of a bump-in-the-wire
DNSSEC signer.
