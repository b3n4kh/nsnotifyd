.Nd handle DNS NOTIFY messages by running a command
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46d

.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl s Ar authority
.Op Fl a Ar addr
.Op Fl p Ar port

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon
monitors a set of DNS zones
and runs a command when any of them change.
It listens for DNS NOTIFY messages
so it can respond to changes promptly.
It also uses the zone SOA refresh and retry parameters
to poll for updates if it does not receive any NOTIFY messages.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 only
(apart from DNS queries made using the system resolver configuration).
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 only
(apart from DNS queries made using the system resolver configuration).
.It Fl a Ar address
Listen on
.Ar address
for NOTIFY messages.
The default is
.Li 127.0.0.1 .
.Pp
You can specify an IP address or hostname.
A hostname is looked up using the system resolver.
If it resolves to multiple addresses then one
arbitrary address is chosen,
constrained by the
.Fl 4
or
.Fl 6
options.
.It Fl d
Debugging mode.
.Pp
Use once to prevent
.Nm
from daemonizing
and to make it print log messages to stderr.
.Pp
Use twice to get dumps of DNS packets.
.It Fl l Ar facility
Set the
.Xr syslog 3
facility.
The default is
.Va daemon .
.It Fl P Ar path
Write the
.Nm
PID to the given
.Ar path
after daemonizing
and before dropping privilege.
.It Fl p Ar port
Listen on
.Ar port
instead of the default port 53
.Dq domain .
.It Fl s Ar authority
Specify an authoritative server to
use for zone SOA refresh queries.
By default
.Nm
does periodic refreshes
using the system recursive resolver,
so its refresh queries may get stale cached answers.
.Pp
You can specify an IP address or hostname.
A hostname is looked up using the system resolver,
constrained by the
.Fl 4
or
.Fl 6
options.
.It Fl u Ar user
Drop privilege to
.Ar user
after daemonizing.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
daemon is not very secure.
.Pp
It accepts any well-formed NOTIFY message,
regardless of the source.
It does not support TSIG authentication (RFC 2845)
for access control.
It is easy to flood
.Nm
with more notifications than it can handle.
.Pp
You should configure it to listen on a loopback address
(which is the default)
or use a packet filter to block unwanted traffic.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon
is not aware of the authoritative servers for a zone,
so it cannot filter spurious NOTIFY messages.
It has a very simplistic mechanism
for choosing which servers to query when refreshing a zone.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon cannot accept NOTIFY messages over TCP.
(It does not conform to RFC 5966.)
It does not support EDNS (RFC 6891).
However,
NOTIFY messages and responses are very small,
so following these specifications should not be necessary in practice.
.Sh NON-BUGS
It only handles one query at a time,
which prevents it from becoming a fork bomb.
.Pp
It cannot be used to amplify spoofed UDP packets.
