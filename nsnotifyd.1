.Nd handle DNS NOTIFY messages by running a command
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 46d

.Op Fl P Ar pidfile
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl s Ar authority
.Op Fl a Ar addr
.Op Fl p Ar port

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon
monitors a set of DNS
.Ar zones
and runs a
.Ar command
when any of them change.
It listens for DNS NOTIFY messages
so it can respond to changes promptly.
It also uses each zone's SOA refresh and retry parameters
to poll for updates if
.Nm
does not receive NOTIFY messages more frequently.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl 4
Use IPv4 only
(apart from DNS queries made using the system resolver configuration).
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 only
(apart from DNS queries made using the system resolver configuration).
.It Fl a Ar address
Listen on
.Ar address
for NOTIFY messages.
The default is
.Li 127.0.0.1 .
.Pp
You can specify an IP address or hostname.
A hostname is looked up using the system resolver.
If it resolves to multiple addresses then one
arbitrary address is chosen,
constrained by the
.Fl 4
or
.Fl 6
options.
.It Fl d
Debugging mode.
.Pp
Use once to prevent
.Nm
from daemonizing
and to make it print log messages to stderr.
.Pp
Use twice to get dumps of DNS packets.
.It Fl l Ar facility
Set the
.Xr syslog 3
facility.
The default is
.Va daemon .
.It Fl P Ar path
Write the
.Nm
PID to the given
.Ar path
after daemonizing
and before dropping privilege.
.It Fl p Ar port
Listen on
.Ar port
instead of the default port 53
.Dq domain .
.It Fl s Ar authority
Specify an authoritative server to
use for zone SOA refresh queries.
By default
.Nm
does periodic refreshes
using the system recursive resolver,
so its refresh queries may get stale cached answers.
.Pp
You can specify an IP address or hostname.
A hostname is looked up using the system resolver,
constrained by the
.Fl 4
or
.Fl 6
options.
.It Fl u Ar user
Drop privilege to
.Ar user
after daemonizing.
.El
.Sh DETAILS
.Ss Startup
Before daemonizing,
.Nm
makes SOA queries for each zone
to initialize its refresh and retry timers.
.Ss Server
The
.Nm
daemon acts as a very simple UDP-only DNS server.
The only DNS queries handled by
.Nm
are NOTIFY messages for
.Ar zones
given on the command line.
Other queries are rejected with a
.Va REFUSED
response code, or
.Va FORMERR
if the query is too mangled.
.Ss Zone refresh process
When
.Nm
receives a NOTIFY,
or when a refresh or retry timer expires,
it makes a SOA query to see if the zone has changed.
The SOA query is sent to the source of the NOTIFY
or, if a timer expired, to the server given in the
.Fl s
option.
.Pp
When a zone's serial number increases,
.Nm
runs the
.Ar command
with two or three arguments:
.Bl -enum
.It
the
.Ar zone
name;
.It
its serial number;
.It
the source address of the NOTIFY,
or no third argument if the update was found via a periodic refresh or retry.
.El
.Pp
When the command exits successfully,
.Nm
updates its copy of the zone's SOA parameters.
It will then poll the zone on its refresh interval.
.Pp
If the SOA query or command fails,
.Nm
does not update its SOA parameters,
and polls the zone on its retry interval.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
daemon is not very secure.
.Pp
It accepts any well-formed NOTIFY message,
regardless of the source.
It does not support TSIG authentication (RFC 2845)
for access control.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon
only handles one query at a time,
which prevents it from becoming a fork bomb.
However, you can easily overwhelm it
with more notifications than it can handle.
A spoofed NOTIFY will make
.Nm
send a SOA query to the spoofed source address
and wait for a reply (which will probably not arrive),
during which time it is unresponsive.
.Pp
You should configure
.Nm
to listen on a loopback address
(which is the default)
or use a packet filter to block unwanted traffic.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon
is not aware of the authoritative servers for a zone,
so it cannot filter spurious NOTIFY messages.
It has a very simplistic mechanism
for choosing which servers to query when refreshing a zone.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon cannot accept NOTIFY messages over TCP (RFC 5966).
It does not support EDNS (RFC 6891).
However,
NOTIFY messages and responses are very small,
so following these specifications should not be necessary in practice.
